    <h1>For the love of African Elephants</h1>

    <p>The largest land mammal on earth, the African elephant weighs up to eight tons. The elephant is distinguished by its
    massive body, large ears and a long trunk, which has many uses ranging from using it as a hand to pick up objects, as a
    horn to trumpet warnings, an arm raised in greeting to a hose for drinking water or bathing.</p>
    <p>Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while male elephants
    tend to live in isolation. A single calf is born to a female once every 4-5 years and after a gestation period of 22
    monthsâ€”the longest of any mammal. These calves stay with their mothers for years and are also cared for by other females
    in the group.</p>
